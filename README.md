# Maths
ETNA Maths project (M2)

This project is a school duty on matrix.

## Matrices
The Matrices project contains some useful functions :
 - Sum
 - Multiplication
 - Transposition
 - Trace
 - Gauss

### Gauss
The Gauss algorithm aim is to determine the solutions of a equation system. It will inverse the matrice based on the system and reveal the good x/y/z/... factors.

## Diagonalisation
This project provides two features : 
 - Get the roots of a third degree polynomial, and factoring it
 - Extract the characteristic polynomial of a 3x3 matrix
 
## Technologies
 - PHP
 - HTML
 - Bootstrap for the CSS
